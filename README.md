# emacs
My Emacs configuration

* My actual configuration files are modularised in the [init](init) directory.
* The files `.emacs-*.el` are the `~/.emacs` files I'm using on my various computers.  They load a subset of the configuration modules in [init](init).
* They generally first set up the load path, then load the desired modules, then perform some customisations that have not yet found their way into the modules.
